# MillzMaleficarum Codex v0.3 Update Summary

## Issue Fixed: Content Not Updating After Upload

This update fixes a critical issue where uploaded content was not being displayed on the site even after successful uploads. The root cause was a combination of browser caching, API response handling, and potential file system issues in the persistent storage.

## Changes Implemented

### Server-Side Changes
1. **Enhanced API Endpoints**: Added cache control headers to prevent browser caching
2. **Improved File Handling**: Added extensive validation and logging for file uploads
3. **Error Handling**: Added detailed error reporting in API responses
4. **File Management**: Added backup creation during file uploads

### Client-Side Changes
1. **Cache Busting**: Added timestamp parameter to all API requests
2. **Cache Control**: Added cache-busting headers to fetch requests
3. **UI Enhancements**: Added Refresh button to main interface
4. **Error Reporting**: Improved error messages displayed to users

### New Features
1. **Cache Tools Utility**: Created `/clear-cache.html` for advanced cache management
2. **Server Status Checker**: Added functionality to verify server connection
3. **Deployment Script**: Simplified deployment with `deploy.sh`

## How to Deploy the Update

1. Ensure the Fly CLI is installed:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Use the included deployment script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. Or deploy manually:
   ```bash
   export FLYCTL_INSTALL='/root/.fly'
   export PATH="$FLYCTL_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
   fly deploy
   ```

4. After deployment, restart the machine to ensure changes take effect:
   ```bash
   fly machine restart
   ```

## How to Use the New Features

### Refresh Button
- Located in the footer next to the mode toggle buttons
- Click to force refresh content without reloading the page

## Testing the Update

2. Verify it appears immediately in the magazine viewer
3. If not visible, click the "Refresh" button
4. For persistent issues, use the Cache Tools utility

## Verification Steps
